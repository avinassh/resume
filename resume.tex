\section{Experience}
\cventry{Jun 2013 -- March 2014}{Project engineer}{VLEAD}{Hyderabad}{}{Virtual Labs Engineering and Architecture Division (VLEAD), based in IIIT-Hyderabad, is one of the several teams working on the Govt. of India funded 'Virtual Labs' project. The projectâ€™s goal is to build labs in engineering and sciences providing real lab experience to all students with as minimum requirements as a computer system and an internet connection.\newline{}
\textbf{Major works}:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \href{https://github.com/vlead/ovpl}{OVPL} - One VM Per Lab is a system which enables developers one click deployment of their Virtual Labs. I was one of the four contributors, worked on writing servers using Tornado and I improved system performance by 40\%. The project is opensource and can be found \href{https://github.com/vlead/ovpl}{here}.
\item {UIR} - UIR is a responsive UI framework for Virtual Labs. It is written mostly using CSS3 and bit of LESS. I conceived of, designed and created the UI and framework, which led to 67\% increase in site traffic and 92\% increase in performance.
\item \href{https://github.com/vlead/simo}{SIMO} - SIMO (Seamless Integration of MirrOring and syncing) is bot which enables syncing of Bazaar, Git and SVN repositories to a remote Git server, without actually converting repositories of different version control to Git. The project is opensource and can be found \href{https://github.com/vlead/simo}{here}.
